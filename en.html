            Software Engineer <a href="https://www.sdui.de/">Sdui</a>, Koblenz
            <p>
              In addition to classic MVC with Laravel, I have been heavily involved in the development of
              domain components in the school organization, including timetables and digital class registers.
            </p>
            <p>
              ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipes of unreliable data and integration of external web services.
              A highlight of the work was the implementation of a public API that gave us control over the data
              specification (inversion of control).
            </p>
            <p>
              During this time, I learned a lot about readable code and found my personal style, why DRY
              doesn't always make sense, why Gherkin style is a wonderful idea, how software is created in accordance
              with Conway's Law, and that <code class="code">// TODO:</code> comments will remain forever.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Working student <a href="https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/de/ff/eas.html"> Fraunhofer IIS/EAS</a>, Dresden
            <p>
              Test automation with Python. My team's project focused on design automation for analog circuits.
            </p>
            <p>
              The test suite did not consist of regular software tests, but rather verification routines in
              third-party software. Circuit designs were checked for compliance with design rules and field effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              My task was to automate the execution of the eCAD software Cadence and the verification software Calibre.
              I then evaluated the results and made them available to the engineers. Finally, I integrated the
              test suite into a CI/CD pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>
              At that time, I learned a lot about the testing principles of the <a href="https://istqb.org/">ISTQB</a>,
              Python, loving the Zen of Python, and working in a public institute.
            </p>
            <p>
              I finished my time as a working student after a year and a half with my bachelor's thesis,
              which I was allowed to write in-house.
